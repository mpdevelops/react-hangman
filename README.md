## How to Play

Hangman is a word guessing game. You will be provided with a set number of spaces and must guess a letter for each space. The goal is to guess the full word. Selection options will be presented to you in form of buttons. Incorrect selections will cause a part of the hanging man to be drawn. If the full hanging man is drawn, you lose.
